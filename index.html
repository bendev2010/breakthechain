            <p>
                Within my childhood I was exposed to many of the assemblies and information on the danger of alcohol.
                Being too young I believe we did not take in the information to its full extent. The addictive traits seen in my family history was oblivious to me and my young mind,
                and it wasn't until that addiction took my moms life when I was nine when I starting taking more interest in becoming familiar with the addictive traits in my family.
                Using my story I aim to bring awareness to more of those who may be in the same situation and help them to break the chain as I did and help those in their family before it takes the life of another.
